OpenHAT is intended to be an open and friendly community. It doesn't matter whether you want to submit a bug or feature request, improve code or documentation, provide a plugin or other assets - all contributions are welcome.

OpenHAT uses the the Collective Code Construction Contract (C4) as basis for collaboration. You can find these rules online at [https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/). By making a contribution to OpenHAT you agree to these rules.

To contribute to the code you should fork the [master branch on Github](https://github.com/openhat-org/OpenHAT).  
Please see the [Development](development.md) section for information about building, API contracts and more. Once development is complete commit your changes and issue a pull request. Your patch will be reviewed and integrated into the main repository.
