## Plans for further development



- AndroPDI GUI:
	- general re-design of the architecture
	- make unit and icon specifications more flexible
	- support port plugins (downloadable)
	- error state handling requires improvement (querying interrupts scrolling)
	- GUI needs more beautiful and consistent design
