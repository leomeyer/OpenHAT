## Plans for further development

- Plugins
	- NanoPi GPIO plugin
	- Raspberry Pi GPIO plugin

- Building and packaging
	- make system: compile C and C++ sources separately (required for clang)
	- make system: unify plugin makefile structure
	- make system: improve plugin testing and packaging support

- AndroPDI GUI
	- general re-design of the architecture
	- make unit and icon specifications more flexible
	- support port plugins (downloadable)
	- error state handling requires improvement (querying interrupts scrolling)
	- GUI needs more beautiful and consistent design
