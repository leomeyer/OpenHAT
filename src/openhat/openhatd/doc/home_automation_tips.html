<h1>Home Automation Tips</h1>
<p>Some tips to help you decide how to automate your home. These are only my opinions. YMMV.</p>

<h2>1. Get a good idea about what you want to automate</h2>
<p>Home automation is an endless topic. Automating downright everything, however, is not very useful. There are
a few main areas where home automation makes sense:
<ul>
<li>Energy optimization. Logging and optimizing e. g. heating, aerating, electric power usage etc. can help you save
energy and cost.</li>
<li>Comfort. Automating processes can help maintain a comfortable climate even while you're away.</li>
<li>Safety. This topic includes e. g. alarms (movement and smoke detectors) and deterrence (absence lighting).</li>
<li>Fun and learning! Home automation is fun and can teach you a great deal about electronics and programming.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not automate all critical functions! Home automation electronics may fail due to numerous reasons. Provide some
fallback in case an important component breaks! Not every light switch needs to be replaced by a relay, for example.</p>

<p>Some possible applications:
<ul>
<li>In winter, to save heating energy, shutters should be closed at night to minimize energy loss. During daytime they
should be open to allow for solar radiation gains. Aerating should be short.</li>
<li>In summer, shutters and windows should be closed at daytime. Windows should be opened at night to allow cool air to
enter. This will minimize the energy required for air conditioning.</li>
<li>Heating equipment can be turned down when nobody is at home. An hour or so before residents return it could be turned
up again.</li>
<li>In the dark season it is nice to be awaken by a dimmer that slowly fades on the light to imitate a sunrise.</li>
<li>If you have a photovoltaic system you can adjust your energy consumption to momentary sunshine conditions.</li>
<li>Home automation can be used to regulate temperature and/or moisture, and for plant watering and pet feeding.</li>
<li>Data logging. It is interesting to get a general idea what is going on in a home, whether you want to monitor temperatures,
energy or water consumption, weather data or other information, especially while you're not at home.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Consumer electronics is daily getting more "intelligent". In an ideal world each device would possess standardized
interfaces to allow for some external control. For example, dishwashers or washing machines could be externally started.
The target temperature of fridges and heaters could be controlled. Entertainment equipment could be integrated.
While some of these are already supported things in general are far from being standardized, and solutions are proprietary and
in some cases prohibitively expensive. Until reasonable standards are developed your only possibility here is some kind of
DIY solution.</p>

<h2>2. Hard- and software</h2>
<p>There are (at least) two approaches you can take if you want to start out with home automation. First you can utilize
some of the many specialized products on the market. Second, you can buy general components and build something on your own.</p>

<p>You probably won't build everything from scratch. Making window shutters and other mechanical equipment is not for
everyone, so you will probably need to buy those things if you need them. The main problem is to connect them to an
automation system you can then program to your needs.</p>

<p>If you buy an off-the-shelf automation solution you will probably get a central server plus a number of additional
sensors and actors. Let's call this the "centralized" approach. The pros of this approach are:
<ul>
<li>You get a solution that "just works" plus detailed instructions how to set everything up quickly.</li>
<li>You get manufacturer support.</li>
<li>There are no safety issues as long as you follow the instructions. Professionals will be able to help you.</li>
</ul>
There are, however, some disadvantages:
<ul>
<li>These systems can be an order of magnitude more expensive than something you build on your own.</li>
<li>You probably need to plan a lot in advance to get the wiring etc. right. If you forget something, adding it later might
be unfeasible.</li>
<li>If something breaks down (perhaps after several years, but eventually it will) it may be difficult to replace or repair.
In order to make the system functional again you might have to spend a lot on new hardware.</li>
<li>Sensors or actors you might need or want to add later may simply not exist. Integrating self-made solutions may not
always be possible.</li>
<li>There may be limitations on how you can combine your components. If you're unlucky you find out about these limitations
only after purchasing the equipment.</li>
<li>Software is often closed-source. Manufacturers typically stop supporting their stuff after some time which means
you won't get software updates or additional functionality any more.</li>
<li>Depending on where the automation data is stored there may be data privacy issues.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The exact opposite of this approach could be called the "decentralized" approach. Its main principles are
<ol>
<li>Use cheap, readily replacable components.</li>
<li>Start small and extend the system step by step.</li>
<li>Distribute functions instead of building one central server.</li>
<li>Use a free, open source automation software that you have some degree of control over.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The advantages of this approach are:
<ul>
<li>It will usually be cheaper (in terms of money, not time).</li>
<li>Extending the system or replacing parts becomes easier.</li>
<li>You have full control over the data in your system. Data does not need to leave your home.</li>
<li>You have full control over the software. You can modify and extend its functionality or provide support for devices
that may exist only in the future.</li>
<li>You can learn a lot.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>However, there are of course some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safety. You will probably have to work with dangerous voltages. You need to be competent with electrical installations
before wiring your own home automation. Personal or property damage might result!</li>
<li>You'll probably spend more time designing and building such a system than using ready-made components.</li>
<li>Understanding and modifying open-source software is not for everybody. It can take a lot of time.</li>
<li>If you have problems you are probably on your own. Professional electricians might have trouble helping you.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<h2>3. Wired or wireless?</h2>
<p>In general I'd recommend to go with a wired approach because it is usually much more reliable than wireless solutions.
If you absolutely need to go with a wireless solution I'd prefer WLAN over Bluetooth or 433 MHz based products. WLAN systems
with for example an ESP8266 are cheap and easy to build and usually more reliable than other systems. There are proprietary
standards that might work well, too, if you buy a ready-made solution.</p>

<p>If you are planning the wiring in your home I'd recommend the following:
<ul>
<li>You'll need space for your home automation electronics. Plan distribution boards in places where it is convenient to
have the wiring end, and make them large enough to hold all fuses, sockets, control equipment, and actors. Some reserve can't
hurt. I'd recommend to have a distribution board for each floor or couple of rooms to keep things decentralized and clear.</li>
<li>Plan for two or more power sockets every two or three meters. This might seem much, but believe me, it isn't. Three
power sockets in the corners and two in the middle of the walls are ok. Kitchens need more.</li>
<li>Every three or four meters, plan a network cable (CAT5 or better) and a four-wire telephone line. This will give you
a lot of flexibility in your wiring later on.</li>
<li>Plan additional wires to places where devices are to be installed (e. g. meters, heating equipment etc.). For windows and
shutters, plan main voltage plus some control lines. Four-wire telephone cable is good for control lines.</li>
<li>If you are doing the wiring yourself, add more wires. Even if you don't need them all the labor cost saved greatly exceeds
the material price.</li>
<li>If you are making a wooden floor you can hide a distribution board under a hatch.</li>
<li>Follow the rules and regulations for your electrical installations! If you are unsure, get professional help.</li>
</ul></p>
